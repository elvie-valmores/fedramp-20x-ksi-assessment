"""Mechanism: ask a cloud API what a resource is actually configured as.

Used for evidence of the form "this security control is switched on."
Each supported resource gets its own handler method, because "is it on?"
means something different per service -- a Config recorder has a
recording flag, an asset feed has a list of watched types.

Check params:
    provider  "aws" or "gcp"
    resource  which handler to use, e.g. "config_recorder"
    ...       plus whatever that handler needs (see each method)

Params are required rather than defaulted. A check definition records
*what was checked*, and a hidden default would leave that unstated.

Handlers added from 2026-09-23 split in two: a fetch that calls the API,
and a pure evaluate_* function that judges what was fetched. The split is
so self_test.py can hand each judgement a configuration that should fail
it -- the earlier handlers predate that and have no negative control yet.

The bucket handlers take their population from s3:ListBuckets rather than
from a list in the check. "Every bucket" is the claim, and a list in the
check would make it "every bucket someone remembered to add".
